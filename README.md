# 2D Fantasy RPG
Top-down fantasy Role-playing Game, created in Unity.

# Update 1
I started out with a test scene, where I could test my implementations quickly. I have now switched over to the actual scene that is going to be the tutorial scene (where the player will have his first contact with the game).

What's new?
- Finished the basic environment in the tutorial scene
- Finished part 1 of the quest line on the tutorial island
- Scenemanagement (Able to enter and leave buildings / areas through doors)
- Inventory Manager (equip items, unequip items)
- Interact with NPCs (Questgivers)


To do:
- Implement singleton design to better switch between scenes (GameManager, InventoryManager, Cameras, Player, EventSystem, etc.)
- Vendor NPCs so players are able to buy and sell items
